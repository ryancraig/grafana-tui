title: External Annotations
description: Overlay read-only point events from a JSONL file or command.
---

grafana-tui can overlay read-only, external point events from exactly one source:
a JSONL file or a command provider. It never edits or writes either source.
External annotations are deliberately separate from Grafana dashboard
annotations: grafana-tui does not implement Grafana annotation queries, APIs,
`annotations`, or `annotations.list`.

## Enable Annotations

Select exactly one source. For a file source, pass the path on the command
line:

```bash
grafana-tui \
  --grafana-json ./dashboard.json \
  --annotations-file ./events.jsonl
```

Or configure the file source in TOML:

```toml
annotations_file = "./events.jsonl"
```

For a command source, configure an executable that accepts the request protocol
below. The command receives no shell interpolation:

```toml
[annotations_command]
program = "./target/debug/examples/git_annotation_provider"
args = ["."]
timeout = "10s"
```

Or select it from the command line:

```bash
grafana-tui \
  --grafana-json ./dashboard.json \
  --annotations-command ./target/debug/examples/git_annotation_provider \
  --annotations-command-arg=.
```

Annotation files larger than 16 MiB are rejected with a warning, and at most
100,000 events, the newest, are kept from either kind of source.

File and command sources are mutually exclusive. A TOML configuration that
sets both is rejected even if the CLI selects a source. A CLI file or command
replaces the complete TOML annotation source; it never mixes a CLI program,
arguments, or timeout with TOML values. Sources are opt-in and read-only;
grafana-tui does not create, edit, or otherwise write them.

## Command Provider Protocol

grafana-tui writes exactly one version-1 request line to the command's standard
input, then closes stdin. The request defines the complete refresh window:

```json
{"version":1,"range":{"from":"2026-08-12T10:00:00Z","to":"2026-08-12T10:05:00Z"}}
```

`range.from` and `range.to` are inclusive UTC RFC 3339 bounds. grafana-tui
defensively applies its visible-range filtering to the events returned.

The provider writes zero or more existing JSONL events to stdout and diagnostics
to stderr. Exit `0` with valid bounded JSONL replaces the complete annotation
snapshot; an empty successful stdout clears it. A spawn failure, timeout,
nonzero exit, invalid UTF-8 or JSONL, or oversized stdout keeps the last valid
snapshot and shows a warning.

The default timeout is 10 seconds. grafana-tui accepts at most 10 MiB of stdout
and captures at most 64 KiB of stderr. A provider must finish its work before
it exits: on Linux and macOS it runs in its own process group, and when the
refresh ends (successfully, with an error or timeout, or because grafana-tui
quits) any processes it started are killed. On Windows only the provider
process itself is stopped. Providers inherit grafana-tui's current
directory and environment. Put credentials in that environment or use standard
credential tooling; never place secrets in dashboard JSON or command arguments.

The included Git provider is a practical starting point:

```bash
cargo build --example git_annotation_provider
printf '%s\n' '{"version":1,"range":{"from":"2026-08-12T10:00:00Z","to":"2026-08-12T10:05:00Z"}}' \
  | ./target/debug/examples/git_annotation_provider .
```

## JSONL Event Format and Targeting

The file contains one JSON object per line. Blank lines are ignored. Each event
requires `time` to be an RFC3339 string with an explicit timezone or offset
(numeric timestamps are rejected) and non-empty `text`. `tags` is an optional
array of non-empty strings.

```json
{"time":"2026-07-23T14:30:00Z","text":"Maintenance window","tags":["maintenance"]}
{"time":"2026-07-23T14:30:00Z","text":"Deployed v2.4","tags":["deploy","production"],"panel_titles":["HTTP Request Rate by Status Code"]}
```

Omit `panel_titles` to target all eligible graph and timeseries panels, as in
the first event. When `panel_titles` is present, it must contain one or more
non-blank titles and each title is matched exactly and case-sensitively against
eligible graph/timeseries panel titles as displayed, after dashboard variables
are interpolated (so a repeated panel's copies each have their own title).
`null`, an empty array, and blank titles are validation errors.

If a title occurs on multiple eligible panels, the event fans out to all of
them and grafana-tui shows one warning for that duplicate title. A title that is
missing, or exists only on a non-graph panel, shows one warning and renders no
marker for that title. These titles are grafana-tui routing labels, not Grafana
panel IDs.

Events are ordered by timestamp. Unknown JSON fields are ignored. Times with
fractional seconds are accepted, and the full fractional timestamp is used when
projecting an event onto the graph even when the space-limited inline timestamp
display shows less precision.

## Target, Filter, Inspect, and Reload

This walkthrough uses current UTC timestamps so both events fall in the visible
15-minute range. It uses only POSIX shell tools; no `jq` is required.

First, start the bundled Prometheus demo stack from the repository root:

```bash
cd examples/demo && docker-compose up -d && sleep 5 && cd ../..
```

Then create the annotation file and run grafana-tui:

```bash
annotation_demo_file=/tmp/grafana-tui-annotations-demo.jsonl
annotation_demo_time="$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")"

printf '{"time":"%s","text":"Maintenance window","tags":["maintenance"]}\n' \
  "$annotation_demo_time" > "$annotation_demo_file"
printf '{"time":"%s","text":"API deployed","tags":["deploy","production"],"panel_titles":["HTTP Request Rate by Status Code"]}\n' \
  "$annotation_demo_time" >> "$annotation_demo_file"

cargo run -- \
  --grafana-json examples/dashboards/prometheus_demo.json \
  --prometheus-url http://localhost:19090 \
  --range 15m \
  --annotations-file "$annotation_demo_file"
```

`Maintenance window` appears on every graph/timeseries panel. `API deployed`
appears only on `HTTP Request Rate by Status Code`. Press `t`, select `deploy`
with `Space`, and press `Enter`; only the targeted deployment remains. Press
`v`, move the cursor to the marker, and press `Enter`; the selected panel's
cluster list and selected-event detail pane open.

While grafana-tui is running, append an event in a second terminal:

```bash
annotation_demo_file=/tmp/grafana-tui-annotations-demo.jsonl
annotation_demo_time="$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")"
printf '{"time":"%s","text":"Rollback started","tags":["rollback","production"],"panel_titles":["HTTP Request Rate by Status Code"]}\n' \
  "$annotation_demo_time" >> "$annotation_demo_file"
```

The new event is loaded after the normal refresh; grafana-tui does not need to
restart. With only `deploy` selected, `Rollback started` remains hidden. Press
`t`, then `c`, and press `Enter` to apply the cleared filter and reveal the
rollback marker. Alternatively, select `rollback` in the filter and apply it.

## Tag Filter and Cluster Controls

Press `t` to open the global annotation tag filter. It is runtime-only: it is
not written to the JSONL source or configuration, and applies to every eligible
panel. Selected tags use exact, case-sensitive OR matching: an event remains
visible when it has any selected tag. With no selected tags, events with and
without tags remain visible. The catalogue keeps a selected tag with a zero
event count so it can be removed after a reload.

In the tag filter, use `Up`/`Down` or `j`/`k` to move, `Space` to toggle the
highlighted tag, `c` to clear the draft, `Enter` to apply it, or `Esc` to
cancel without changing the applied filter. In inspection mode, `Enter` opens
only the cluster actually rendered by the selected panel at the cursor. In the
cluster, use `Up`/`Down` or `j`/`k` to select an event, `PgUp`/`PgDn` to page,
and `Enter` or `Esc` to close. Mouse input is ignored while either annotation
modal is open.

Cluster contents are frozen when the cluster opens: a later reload can replace
the live annotation snapshot without moving rows or changing the cluster's
event details.

## Automatic Reload, Rendering, and Exports

grafana-tui refreshes both source types during each normal refresh, including
while markers are hidden. It checks a file source's metadata and, when it
changes, reads, parses, and validates the full candidate file before atomically
replacing the snapshot. A zero-byte file is a valid update that clears all
events. Command and Prometheus refreshes share the same time range, start
together, and redraw together. Annotation loading is independent of Prometheus:
annotation failures never fail startup or a Prometheus refresh.

Only `graph` and `timeseries` panels receive annotation markers. Press `a` to
toggle marker visibility. Events that project to the same terminal column are
shown as one counted marker: `•` for one event, decimal `2`–`9` for two through
nine events, and `+` for 10 or more. In inspection mode, moving the cursor onto
that column shows the cluster's timestamp, text, and tags inline; multi-event
details report the exact cluster count.

Applied panel targeting and tag filtering affect the markers in SVG/PNG exports
and changed-frame recordings. Active inline annotation details are exportable;
the tag-filter and cluster modal chrome is not.

## Errors and Last Valid Snapshot

If a file is missing, unreadable, or contains a malformed event, grafana-tui keeps
rendering the last valid snapshot and shows an annotation warning. Command
provider failures follow the same rule. A bad update does not replace the
previously loaded events, fail startup, or fail the Prometheus refresh.

## CI/CD and Provider Integrations

```text
CI workflow → durable deployment/release record → command provider query
            → normalized JSONL point events → grafana-tui overlay
```

GitHub Actions is a useful concrete pattern: let a workflow record deployment,
release, or workflow outcomes in an API, object store, database, or shared event
log. A local provider receives grafana-tui's requested range and queries that
system of record, then emits normalized JSONL point events. Useful tags include
repository, workflow, environment, status, commit, and deployment.

Give the provider credentials through its environment or standard credential
tooling, never dashboard JSON or command arguments. A shared JSONL file is a
reasonable source only when the workflow and grafana-tui genuinely share storage;
do not commit an ever-growing event log to the application repository.
Vendor-specific providers should normally live as user or community plugins.
Built-in integrations remain demand-driven.

## Current Limits and Roadmap

This feature supports one external file or command source, point events,
panel-title routing, and one global runtime-only tag filter. It has no stable
event IDs, no per-panel tag filters, no multiple sources, and no editing. It
does not add Grafana annotation-query/API compatibility. Range events, stable
event IDs, and per-panel tag filters remain deferred. `--validate` validates
Grafana dashboard imports only; it does not validate annotations.
