# Grafatui Roadmap

Grafatui is a terminal-based Grafana-like UI for Prometheus. The roadmap is
oriented around two priorities:

1. **Grafana parity** - imported dashboards should preserve as much meaning as a
   terminal UI can reasonably express.
2. **User-visible product value** - parity work should make real dashboards
   easier to read, debug, and share.

For a field-by-field breakdown of Grafana JSON compatibility, see the
[compatibility matrix](docs/grafana-compatibility.md). Keep that document
refreshed alongside parity work so it stays aligned with the current release.

### External Annotation Iterations

| Iteration | Scope | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | External JSONL point annotations | ✅ Shipped |
| 2 | Navigable annotation popup, panel targeting, and tag filtering | ✅ Shipped |
| 3 | Bounded command provider protocol and Prometheus-coordinated refresh | ✅ Implemented by this PR |

These iterations are separate from Grafana `annotations` and `annotations.list`,
which remain unsupported.

## Roadmap Principles

Roadmap items are prioritized by:

1. **Grafana parity impact** - Does this make imported Grafana dashboards behave
   more like users expect?
2. **User-visible value** - Does this make dashboards more readable, trustworthy,
   or useful in a terminal?
3. **Trust in import results** - Does this reduce silent degradation when a
   dashboard contains unsupported fields?
4. **Implementation complexity** - Can the feature be shipped safely in a small,
   reviewable step?

The intent is to make parity work feel practical rather than academic. For
example, unit support is not just `fieldConfig.defaults.unit`; it is the
difference between readable latency/cache panels and raw float noise.

`dashboard.grafana.app/v2` API version. V2 semantics with a terminal equivalent
are implemented; browser-only settings, such as viewport-filling rows, are
accepted and ignored. Semantics that are not implemented yet fail with a clear
import error rather than silently changing the dashboard.

| Feature | Grafana field / behavior | User value | Complexity | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|

| **Repeat and dynamic layouts** | Layout and element `repeat` settings | Expands panels or groups from variable values | 🔴 | ✅ |
| **Conditional rendering** | `conditionalRendering` on supported containers | Shows or hides content using v2 conditions | 🔴 | ✅ |
| **Nested layout variables** | Variables scoped to rows and tabs | Preserves local variable scope in dynamic dashboards | 🔴 | ✅ |

| **V2 Resource YAML** | YAML representation of the v2 resource | Supports Grafana's alternative as-code export format | 🟡 | ✅ |

## Best Next Steps

Recommended order for the next focused development cycle:

1. **Automate compatibility truth**
   - Add tests or fixtures for fields already supported by v0.1.9 so the
     compatibility matrix is easier to keep current.
   - Prefer small checks that compare parser behavior with documented support.

2. **Extend the field display layer**
   - Add value mappings and broaden unit coverage beyond the shipped common
     units.
   - Keep the shared display configuration model applied across Stat, Gauge,
     BarGauge, Table, Graph labels, legends, and exports.

3. **Make unsupported imports visible**
   - Track skipped panel types, hidden/unsupported target behavior, and ignored
     high-impact fields.
   - Surface a concise warning in the TUI and a fuller report via `--validate`.

4. **Ship v0.2 as "Grafana Import Fidelity"**
   - Keep the release tightly scoped.
   - Prefer common Grafana dashboard correctness over new non-parity features.

## How to Contribute

If you'd like to help, the best starting points are items marked 🔜 and 🟢.
Roadmap items are especially useful when PRs include:

- A small Grafana JSON fixture that demonstrates the supported field.
- Unit tests for parsing and display behavior.
- A short note in `docs/grafana-compatibility.md` explaining the TUI mapping or
  limitation.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines, and
